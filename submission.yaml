  comment: The drug enables ribosomes to bypass premature stop codons caused by nonsense mutations in the dystrophin gene. This restores the full-length and functional capability of dystrophin. Without the drug, the premature stop codon means that a truncated protein will be produced, which will be unabled to play its role in muscle strenght and proper function leading to the disease. The disease is denoted Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the original file as per DrugCentral.

  comment: The drug allows for the trabecular meshwork in the eye (UBERON:0005969) to open, increasing the outflow of the aqueous humor and having a positive impact on reducing intraocular pressure. Note that MESH:C061212 is not an alternative MESH ID for this drug (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=C061212). The disease is also known as Open-angle glaucoma as per in DrugCentral.

  comment: Levomefolic acid can be found in contraceptive pills as a source of folic acid to help to prevent spinal cord birth defects in an unborn baby. There has not been any evidence to support that levomefolic acid on its own is an indication for acne vulgaris. When combined with hormones such as progestin and estrogen (birth pill) it can be used to treat moderate acne as well as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-154717/beyaz-oral/details), but not on its own.

  comment: The drug stimulates the expression of several genes (e.g. HSP, SOD, etc) but it's not clear if the drug binds to these or other targets to modulate the known actions namely oxygen radical scavenging, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and acceleration of gastrointestinal wound healing.

  comment: The disease, specially the acute form, is mainly caused by infection (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis#Cause), leading to inflammation. So in addition to treating the symptoms (such as spams and GI secretions), antibiotics, anti-virals etc may be needed for treatment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterocolitis#Treatment).

  comment: In Parkinson's disease, there is imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine, where increased levels of acetylcholine and degeneration of dopaminergic pathways are observed. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists block central cholinergic activity and balance out neurotransmitters in the brain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscarinic_antagonist#Effects). Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).

  comment: The antiseizure mechanism of action based on the voltage sodium channels is not a consensus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eslicarbazepine_acetate#Mechanism_of_action). The drug could also bind to calcium channels (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09119#mechanism-of-action). Note that the protein target listed in DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09119#BE0005793) does not seem to be involved in epilepsy, but rather in inflammation and pain.

  comment: This disease is also known as Disorder of lung as per DrugCentral. Note this disease name is a very generic term, that could encompass any diseases of the lungs, including neoplasms, infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) and rare diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis) for which theophylline may not have any therapeutic benefit at all. Therefore, this annotation is done for all lung diseases that could be indications for this drug to encompass diseases that are similar to asthma, bronchitis, COPD and alike.

  comment: The disease is denoted Carcinoma of breast in the original file as per DrugCentral. The drug intercaltes with DNA and prevents DNA replication and downstream processes, some of them involving UniProt:P11388, which leads to cell/tumour death.

  comment: The disease is also known as Deep venous thrombosis as per DrugCentral. Note that among the original MESH IDs for this drug one of them seems to have been deprecated (MESH:C438268) whereas the other (MESH:C049714) is for a compound where no evidence has been found to be related to fondaparinux.

Comment: This disease was named Mixed hyperlipidemia in the original file for curation but it's known as Hyperlipidemia, Familial Combined in MESH. Note there does not seem to be any evidence supporting this drug indication (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_hyperlipidemia#Treatment),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_hyperlipidemia#Treatment),) so this path is hypothetic and based on the disease phenotype (i.e increased LDL and triglyceride concentrations). Other commonly used names for this drug are inositol nicotinate (CHEBI:50134), myo inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:31699) and inositol hexanicotinate (CHEBI:33064)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inositol_nicotinate). This drug is made of niacin (vitamin B3, MESH:D009525) and inositol (MESH:D007294. Note the original drug to curate for this disease was inositol but there is no evidence for it to be used as treatment unless it's bound to nicotinic acid to form inositol hexanicotinate.

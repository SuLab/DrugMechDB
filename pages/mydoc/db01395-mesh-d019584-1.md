Comment: The disease is denoted Menopausal flushing in the original file. Note that a combination therapy of estradiol and drospirenone would be more effective at reducing the frequency of hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms, than a mono-therapy relying on progestin only. Also, since many progestogens have off-target effects including estrogenic effects, the improvement in hot flashes maybe due to the drug binding to estrogen receptors instead. Note the term Vasomotor System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasomotor_center) does not seem to be represented in other ontologies.

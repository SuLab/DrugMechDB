Comment: This disease is also known as Disorder of lung as per DrugCentral. Note this disease name is a very generic term, that could encompass any diseases of the lungs, including neoplasms, infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) and rare diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis) for which theophylline may not have any therapeutic benefit at all. Therefore, this annotation is done for all lung diseases that could be indications for this drug to encompass diseases that are similar to asthma, bronchitis, COPD and alike.

Comment: This disease is also known as Herpes simplex keratitis as per DrugCentral. The drug needs to be converted to Vidarabine Phosphate first (monophosphate --> diphosphate --> triphosphate) to become active and exert its role as inhibitor (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/21704#section=Mechanism-of-Action).

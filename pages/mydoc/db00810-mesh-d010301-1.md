Comment: The disease is denoted as Postencephalitic parkinsonism in the original file. This disease is believed to be caused by a viral infection, leading to clinical parkinsonism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postencephalitic_parkinsonism) and anti-Parkinson drugs may be helpful in treating the symptoms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica). For example, muscarinic antagonists can allow dopamine levels to rebalance, which can help relieve some Parkinsonian symptoms e.g. involuntary movements. Anticholinergic drugs may also be prescribed to improve bladder dysfunction (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20370804/).

Comment: In addition to inhibiting UniProt:P05093 (the main target according to [https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB05812#mechanism-of-action),](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB05812#mechanism-of-action),) abiraterone also inhibits all these cytochrome P450s and can be useful in treating castration-resistant prostate cancers.

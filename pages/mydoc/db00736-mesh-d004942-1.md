Comment: Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of Omeprazole, both are a proton pump inhibitor class of drug and the mechanism of action for both is similar. Weve annotated the path for the S isomer only as it seems this isomer is metabolized more slowly than omeprazole and therefore it will act for longer and more effectively (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2036.17.s1.1.x). This disease is denoted as Peptic reflux disease in the original file.

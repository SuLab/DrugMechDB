Comment: This drug is an example of immune checkpoint blockade. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a key immune-checkpoint receptor expressed by activated T cells, and it mediates immunosuppression. Inhibition of the PD-1 protein can enhance T-cell responses and mediate preclinical antitumor activity (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22658127/).

Comment: Levomefolic acid can be found in contraceptive pills as a source of folic acid to help to prevent spinal cord birth defects in an unborn baby. There has not been any evidence to support that levomefolic acid on its own is an indication for acne vulgaris. When combined with hormones such as progestin and estrogen (birth pill) it can be used to treat moderate acne as well as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-154717/beyaz-oral/details), but not on its own.

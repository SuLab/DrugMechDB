Comment: note that this drug is only associated with calcium channel blockers in ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound_report_card/CHEMBL1008/), not with potassium channel blockers (or other targets) as DrugBank has it. This drug is no longer sold in the United States. It's been implicated in causing ventricular arrhythmia.

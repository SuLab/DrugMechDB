Comment: No direct evidence available that support voglibose MoA for Gaucher Disease. However there is a hypothesis that the combination of small Î±-glucosidase inhibitors as pharmacological chaperones (PCs) with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to have a synergic effect in improved enzyme activity and reduction of toxic metabolites in Pompe's disease or Gaucher disease.

Comment: Camphor is analgesic (https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?cpd:C00808). The activation of members of the transient receptor ion channel protein family applications lead to desensitization, which in turn contributes to the analgesic effects of camphor after prolonged/repeated applications (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33804078/).

Comment: The drug enables ribosomes to bypass premature stop codons caused by nonsense mutations in the dystrophin gene. This restores the full-length and functional capability of dystrophin. Without the drug, the premature stop codon means that a truncated protein will be produced, which will be unabled to play its role in muscle strenght and proper function leading to the disease. The disease is denoted Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the original file as per DrugCentral.

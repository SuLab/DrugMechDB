## Relationships


NOTE: predicates are annotated in <a href="https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/releases/tag/v1.3.0">Biolink Model (v1.3.0)</a>

|---------|-----------|---------|
| Subject | Predicate | Object  |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Phenylpropanolamine | INCREASES ACTIVITY OF | Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor |
| Phenylpropanolamine | INCREASES ACTIVITY OF | Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor |
| Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor | NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH | Bronchoconstriction |
| Bronchoconstriction | POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH | Common Cold |
| Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor | POSITIVELY REGULATES | Vasoconstriction |
| Vasoconstriction | NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH | Mucus Secretion |
| Mucus Secretion | POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH | Common Cold |

Comment: Phenylpropanolamine is a sympathomimetic that was previously used in nasal decongestants and weight loss products, but has been withdrawn by the FDA due to safety risks and lack of efficacy.

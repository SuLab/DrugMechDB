Comment: It is proposed that PARP inhibition specifically targets tumor cells with preexisting HRD (homologous recombination deficiency), such as those cells possessing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28790837/). This drug is a potent vasodilator and it's believed that by dilating tumor-supplying vessels, tumor oxygenation will improve, which in turn it would improve radiotherapy, or increase anticancer drug delivery, as well as improve delivery of PARP inhibitor drugs (rucaparib and others) to the tumor, with consequent increased intra-tumoral PARP inhibition (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25689628/).

Comment: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission as listed by DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However, this is contentious and if the drug does modulate GABA it's not known whether it is as agonist or antagonist due to conflicting data (at best it would be a weak modulation seen in animal models only). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them, specially the myoclonic type (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/).

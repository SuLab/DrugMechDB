Comment: This drug may also affect GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00555#BE0000013). However this is rather contentious, so it has not been annotated as such in here. Besides if the drug does modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor it's a rather weak inhibition seen in animal models (yet to be determined in humans). Note that the drug could be contraindicated for treatment of seizures as it can exacerbate them (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9596203/). Finally, note that this disease is denoted as Tonic-clonic seizure in the original file but known as Seizures in MESH.

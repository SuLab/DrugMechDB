Comment: The drug name available in the original file (before curation) was Rutoside. This is one of the synonyms of Rutin, which is the canonical name in DrugBank). Its mechanism of action is not well reported. Some sources have it as an aid to enhance the action of vitamin C (https://www.drugs.com/mtm/rutin.html), whereas others describe rutin (aka vitamin P) acting as a "sparing factor, which slows the oxidation of vitamin C" into dehydroascorbic acid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroascorbic_acid).
